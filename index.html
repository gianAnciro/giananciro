        <h2>About Me  </h2>



<img src="logo.png" alt="me" class="me">



<p>21 years old, from paulba ligao city,
bsis student 3rd year, my motto in life is to treat others the way you want to be treated,

my thoughts on modern art is that people think it is a shortcut and lazy
modern art is throwing arrows mindlessly until you hit something.
lack of consistency and creativity,
is sufficed by burst of efforts and intruiged.
i consider myself a modern artist.
all our actions means just to feel something

i started education in paulba elementary school. we experienced the 90s way.
and its fading.

i continued highschool in paulba national highschool. i think it is the best school. the teachers were very passionate and met new friends

i transferred in senior high to st mary of ligao until graduating 

and then college is bicol university polsngui campus
